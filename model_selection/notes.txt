Idea sketch:

- (unbiased) estimation of generalization _error_
	+ what happens when you measure and *then* change something
	+ evaluation protocols
	+ train, validate, test
	+ cross validation
	+ repeated cross validation
	+ nested cross validation

- data driven decisions
	+ feature selection/extraction, engineering
		. consequences of using the entire data set for transformations
	+ learner selection
	+ hyperparameter selection
	+ model selection
